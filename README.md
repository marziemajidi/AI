# AI Practice Repository

Welcome to my AI Practice Repository!

In this repository, I will share my exercises and projects related to Artificial Intelligence, covering various topics from Machine Learning to Deep Learning. This is a space where I document my learning journey, showcase my work, and explore different techniques and algorithms used in AI.

## Contents

- **Machine Learning**: Here, you will find examples and exercises that demonstrate fundamental concepts in machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, classification, clustering, and more.
  
- **Deep Learning**: This section includes projects and implementations of deep learning architectures, such as neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and more advanced models.

- **Resources**: I will also provide links to tutorials, articles, and other useful resources that I find helpful in my studies.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or use the code for your own learning. I welcome any feedback or suggestions!

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository and navigate to the relevant folders for the exercises or projects you are interested in.
